# BBControl

In order to run this project you will need to have Cabify app and the PlayStore app for the Cab request functionality.

As for the users, there are three types: administrator, waiter and customer; which users are as follows

+ Customer: 
user: vale_9817@hotmail.com
password: 123test

+ Waiter:
user: andrea@bbc.com
password: 123andrea

+ Admin:
user: fduran@adminbbc.com
password: adminwaiter1

For creating waiters, the password is set as "123 + first name" automatically. For instance, if the first name entered corresponds to Maria Camila, then the password will be 123maria, and it will work when trying to log in.
